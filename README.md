                                 INTRODUCTION

•	Business Problem Framing

o	The proliferation of social media enables people to express their opinions widely online. However, at the same time, this has resulted in the emergence of conflict and hate, making online environments uninviting for users. Although researchers have found that hate is a problem across multiple platforms, there is a lack of models for online hate detection.
o	Online hate, described as abusive language, aggression, cyberbullying, hatefulness and many others has been identified as a major threat on online social media platforms. Social media platforms are the most prominent grounds for such toxic behaviour.   
o	There has been a remarkable increase in the cases of cyberbullying and trolls on various social media platforms. Many celebrities and influences are facing backlashes from people and have to come across hateful and offensive comments. This can take a toll on anyone and affect them mentally leading to depression, mental illness, self-hatred and suicidal thoughts.    


•	Conceptual Background of the Domain Problem

o	A large proportion of online comments present on public domains are usually constructive, however a significant proportion are toxic in nature. Dataset is obtained online which are processed to remove noise from the dataset. The comments contain lot of errors which increases the number of features manifold, making the machine learning model to train the dataset by processing the dataset, in the form of transformation of raw comments before feeding it to the Classification models using a machine learning technique known as the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) technique. The logistic regression technique is used to train the processed dataset, which will differentiate toxic comments from non-toxic comments. The multi-headed model comprises toxicity (severe-toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity-hate) or Non-Toxicity Evaluation, using confusion metrics for their prediction.

o	So, primarily we must focus which social handles is used mostly among all and what are the moto of particular social handles who is facing this type of comments.

•	Review of Literature

o	Aggression  by  text  is  a  complex  phenomenon,  and different  knowledge  ﬁelds  try  to  study  and  tackle  this problem. 

o	This  analysis  of  related  workfocuses  on  a  computer science  perspective  of  aggression  identiﬁcation,  a  recent emerging  area.  Currently,  the  scientiﬁc  study  of  automatic identiﬁcation of aggressive text, using information technology techniques,  is  increasing.  In  this  study,  several  related literature  are  used  to  express  different  types  of  aggression. Some  of  those  are  hate  (Tarasova  et  al.8),  cyber  bullying (Adamic9),  abusive  language  (Nobata  et  al.3),  toxicity .


•	Motivation for the Problem Undertaken

o	Because of the most demanding and most exploratory technology i.e. NLP and specifically using machine learning in this type of problem can help me to learn more and explore me more. The following problem statement is also a useful use case because as said earlier comments classification is becoming more important now a days.
